A simple YouTube MP3 downloader using Python and "pytube".

To ensure proper execution of the code in the .py file, the user needs to install the "pytube" package first. This can be done by running the following command in the terminal or command prompt: "pip install pytube" or "pip3 install pytube" depending on the Python version being used.

The code provided should be executed from the command line (cmd) on both Windows or Linux systems. Before running it, the user should navigate to the desired folder where they want the audio to be downloaded, copy its path and paste it to the appropriate place.

Once the pytube package is installed and the desired folder is selected, the user can run the code in the .py file from the cmd / terminal, in order to perform the intended audio download.
